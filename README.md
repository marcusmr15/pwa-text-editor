## Usage

Once the application is running, you can start using `JATE` to create and edit text documents. Here are some key features and functionalities:

- __Offline Editing__: `JATE` allows users to create and edit text documents even when offline. Any changes made offline will be synchronized once back online. This is made possible thanks to `JATE` being a progressive web application (PWA).

- __IndexedDB Integration__: `JATE` uses IndexedDB for local storage. When you open the text editor, IndexedDB immediately creates a database storage. Any content entered is automatically saved to IndexedDB when you click off the DOM window. When you reopen the editor after closing it, the content is retrieved from IndexedDB.

- __Webpack Bundling__: All JavaScript files are bundled using Webpack, ensuring that the application runs smoothly in the browser without errors, even when using next-gen JavaScript.

- __Service Worker and Manifest__: `JATE` uses Workbox for service worker registration, ensuring that static assets are pre-cached upon loading. It also includes a generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file.
